                        I didn't always know that I wanted to do design as a career. Not until the March of 2020, specifically. A UI/UX designathon at my school drew me in, and I instantly fell in love.

                        I'm passionate about the intersection of brilliant and beautiful design. Iâ€™m curious how the maximum utility can be boiled down to the minimal visusal cues.
